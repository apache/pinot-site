releaseNotes: 'Apache Pinot 0.11.0 has introduced many new features to extend the query abilities, e.g. the Multi-Stage query engine enables Pinot to do distributed joins, more sql syntax(DML support), query functions and indexes(Text index, Timestamp index) supported for new use cases. And as always, more integrations with other systems(E.g. Spark3, Flink).'
