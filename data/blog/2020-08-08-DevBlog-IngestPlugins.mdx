One of the primary advantages of using Pinot is its pluggable architecture. The plugins make it easy to add support for any third-party system which can be an execution framework, a filesystem, or input format.

In this tutorial, we will use three such plugins to easily ingest data and push it to our Pinot cluster. The plugins we will be using are -

-   pinot-batch-ingestion-spark
-   pinot-s3
-   pinot-parquet
